There was a steady flow of visitors on Sunday, March 19 inside the Shepherd Sugar Bush. This was the last day of its weekend long open house which was held as a part of a broader Michigan Maple Syrup Weekend event.

Outside, you could see a plume of steam flow through an exhaust pipe, and smell the sweetness of the sap being converted into syrup. Inside the garage, groups of visitors listened to Arnie Hammel talk about the sap collection process.

Inside, you could watch the sap being converted into syrup, and taste test foods flavored with syrup such as candy.
