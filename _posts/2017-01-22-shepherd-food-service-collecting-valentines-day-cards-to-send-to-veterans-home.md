Bluejay Family:
Please take a few minutes out of your week to do an act of kindness, to individuals who have given their time and talents to the Armed Forces, protecting our freedom and rights
The Shepherd Food Service is once again asking you to think of someone really important to our country this Valentine’s Day, your Veterans of the United States. We will be sending your homemade valentines to the Veterans at the Veteran home in Grand Rapids, MI. These men and women deserve our many thanks, and we are asking you to please join with us in making a Veteran’s day brighter. Make a valentine card no bigger than a 5x7 and return it to the red box marked “Valentine for Vets” in your building on or before February 8th.
We have over 500 High School students, and let's see if we can send 500 cards to the Veteran's home. That is your challenge, Bluejays! We hope you go out and accept your mission.
