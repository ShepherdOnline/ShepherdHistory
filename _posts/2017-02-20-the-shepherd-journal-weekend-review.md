<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a </span><a href="http://flip.it/xpMmA9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlight of stories and information shared via Facebook over the last few days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The links are presented inside a platform I’ve used in the past called Flipboard. It is accessible on the web, but the mobile app version works even better. The Flipboard app is free, and you will get updates on your phone when new links are added. And, I am planning on adding additional links.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I resisted the idea of using Flipboard, but after trying a lot of things I’ve reached the conclusion that it just isn’t practical to stay on top of all of the information that is posted. And, sometimes I will want to go deeper and post my own story, while other times what is out there is already enough. Flipboard gives me the flexibility I’ve needed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you see something that you feel should be shared in the Flipboard version of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, send the link or news tip to </span><a href="mailto:editor@shepherdhistory.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">editor@shepherdhistory.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also use the “Contact Us” link on the Facebook page to submit information.</span>
