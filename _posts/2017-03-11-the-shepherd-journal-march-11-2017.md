Check out the<a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/shepherdjrn/dcb-02262017/details"> latest issue of <em>The Shepherd Journal</em></a>, which summarizes news and information which was posted during the last couple of weeks. The link will take you to a page where you can view the issue either on the web or download it as a PDF. You can also respond to the articles from the web version by highlighting sections of the page and then entering your thoughts into a field which will appear on the right hand side.

I am planning on publishing the <em>Shepherd Journal</em> in this format on a weekly basis.

If you or your organization has news that they would like to have shared with the community, there is a page on http://www.shepherdhistory.org where you can submit articles directly to the site. The "Contact Us" button on the Shepherd Journal Facebook page will take you to the form. You can also email articles to <a href="mailto:editor@shepherdhistory.org">editor@shepherdhistory.org</a>.

<em>The Shepherd Journal</em> is a part of an online community archive project that is supported by the Shepherd Area Historical Society. The news, stories, and information we publish will be stored on the Shepherd Online site at <a href="http://www.shepherdhistory.org">http://www.shepherdhistory.org</a> for future reference. Eventually, I'd also like to publish yearly retrospectives.

I am also looking for writers, editors, and photographers who would like to help with the capture of news and information for the Shepherd community.  Contact me if you would like to help or  to find out more.
